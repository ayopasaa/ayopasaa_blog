abstract: The World Health Organization has identified antimicrobial resistance as one of the most important threats to global health. Brazil is one of the world's leading meat producers and the Brazilian use of veterinary antimicrobials as therapeutic agents and prophylactic or growth promoters in animal production remains problematic. Many antimicrobials are not completely metabolized and their excretion represents a significant source of environmental exposure. The aim of this work was to estimate the exposure risk of soil and groundwater to contamination by growth promoters (GPs) and anticoccidial additives (AAs) in Brazil by using a method based on a geographical information system (GIS). The principle adopted is that the greater the amount of animals, the greater the quantity of antimicrobials present, and the greater the soil vulnerability to contamination. Our research showed that GPs and AAs are extensively used in the Brazilian animal production system. An analysis of market data showed that zinc bacitracin, monensin, salinomycin, colistin and tylosin are representative GPs and AAs. This study presents a qualitative approach for risk assessment based on worst-case scenarios. First, the probable environmental concentration was estimated using a correlation between the number of heads of the herds of poultry and cattle, and the amounts of drug released. The leaching risk potential was characterized for each compound, as proposed in ISO 15175. The potential of soil contamination was evaluated for each antimicrobial as a function of its binding and permanence rates. These rates were calculated using georeferenced data of organic carbon, average temperature, water balance and hydro-geological parameters. The consequences were modeled based on Brazilian soil usage. Finally, the risk was calculated by combining the different maps generated using spatial multi-criteria decision analysis. Higher risk was found for the midwest, southeast and south regions of Brazil. Groundwater was found to be more vulnerable than soil.

summary: The model uses relative simple and available data from official sources that were never previously used together for this purpose. Although simple, the qualitative approach based on worst-case scenarios can be used in future research as a way to define possible experimental sites where quantitative analysis could be performed for a better and real risk assessment.
